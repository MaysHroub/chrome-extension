# Chrome Extension

This is the '[Build a Chrome Extension](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v/~03i)' part of the '[Learn JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v)' course by Scrimba. It illustrates how to build a simple chrome extension which mainly saves tabs.

This is my third frontend project in my *"developing my frontend skills to become a full-stack developer so I can land a good job"* journey. 


### This part explained several topics including:
- `const` keyword which defines variables that cannot be assigned again
- `addEventListener()` method to add click (or double-click) listeners to buttons in javascript code
- `innerHtml` property; used when we want to manipulate inner html of an html component
- `input.value` to retrieve the value entered by the user in the input field
- Function parameters
- Template strings
- `localStorage` to store data (as key-value pair, and both of them are strings)
- The JSON object, and how to use JSON.stringify to convert objects to JSON strings and JSON.parse to convert JSON strings to JS objects
- Access/manipulate objects in arrays

## How to setup and use it?

#### Download the files
-   Press `<> Code` (the green button)
-   Navigate to **Local** tab
-   Press **Download ZIP** (The last option)

After that, extract the **.zip** file.

#### Add the files to Chrome Extension
- Go to the extension page of your browser (donated by a puzzle part ðŸ§©) or type `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developer mode, and you will see three buttons have appeared: Load unpack, Pack extension, and Update
- Press **Load unpack** button
- Choose the folder you've extracted
- And enable the extension if it's not already

And voala! You now have the extension enabled and you can use it!

Have fun :3
